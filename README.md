# ECG Signal
## Processing Bio (ECG) Signal
- Electrocardiography - The process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the heart’s electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles
- ECG records impulses to display how fast the heart is beating, rhythm of the heartbeats, and the timing of electrical impulses as they move through different parts of the heart
- Helpful device in medicine used to detect heart-related and health conditions
<br/>

**Functions and stuff**
- `ecg` - ECG signal generator or function from MATLAB[^1]
- $x[n]$ - Input noisy ECG signal sampled at F<sub>s</sub> = 500 Hz
- $s[n]$ - Clean ECG signal generated by filtering the noisy signal $x[n]$ and sigma ($0<sigma<1$)
- $y_{filter}[n]$ - Output ECG signal
- Task in Processing Bio Signal is to reduce the noise fluctuations by filtering or processing $x[n]$ using a moving average Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter of length $M+1$ by using the MATLAB function `conv`
- Results were used to determine the ideal sigma values and filter order M of ECG signals to determine medical diagnostics

Adapted from M&I[^2], the moving average filter is expressed as:

```math
y[n] = \frac{1}{M + 1} \sum_{k=0}^{M} x[n-k]
```
which is used as a model to write the MATLAB code to reduce the noise fluctuations from the noisy signal $x[n]$.

- Sigma values chosen: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7
- Filter orders chosen: 10, 50, and 100
